  "summary": "Toast popups appear to be mostly disabled by swapping Sonner toast calls to a no-op toast utility, but there is still at least one code path that imports and uses Sonner toasts directly (dev-only smoke test), which can still display toasts and violates the “no Sonner toast messages anywhere” requirement.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Disable all automated in-app toast/notification popups so that no Sonner toast messages are shown anywhere in the app (success/info/error), while keeping underlying logic unchanged.",
      "reason": "The diff shows a direct dynamic import and usage of `toast` from `sonner` in HomePage (DEV smoke test). This path can still display Sonner toast popups, contradicting the requirement that no Sonner toast messages are shown anywhere in the app.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/pages/HomePage.tsx (dynamic import: `const { toast } = await import('sonner');` and calls to `toast.info(...)`, `toast.success(...)`, `toast.error(...)`)"

      "description": "DEV-only smoke test runner that triggers Sonner toast notifications via a `?smokeTest=true` URL param.",
      "reason": "Not requested by the BuildRequest; it also conflicts with the goal of removing automated toast messages (it explicitly shows toast.info/success/error).",

        "frontend/src/pages/HomePage.tsx (adds smoke test URL param handling and Sonner toast usage)"
