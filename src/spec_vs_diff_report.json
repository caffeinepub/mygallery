  "summary": "REQ-1 appears to be implemented by adding/using a more reliable `openExternally` helper that uses page visibility/blur/pagehide signals plus short delays to distinguish true popup blocking from successful external navigation, which should prevent the erroneous “Unable to Open Link” fallback when the user returns after a successful open.",
