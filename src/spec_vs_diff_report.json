  "summary": "REQ-5 and REQ-6 appear to be implemented via (1) a hardened folder creation mutation that invalidates and force-refetches the folders query, plus UI error handling when the actor is not ready, and (2) a new swipe-to-reveal row component that hides actions by default, supports touch + mouse dragging, enforces a single open row via parent state, and closes on outside click/tap.",

    {
      "description": "Added/expanded URL parameter + sessionStorage persistence utilities (including hash/query parsing and session persistence helpers), which is unrelated to folder creation flow or swipe-to-reveal folder actions.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest focuses only on folder creation/listing consistency and swipe-to-reveal rename/delete actions; URL param/session persistence behavior was not requested.",
