  "summary": "The implementation covers all core requirements for the floating file stack feature, including animation, UI components, and file management operations. However, REQ-2 (hiding the collection area) is not fully implemented based on available evidence.",

      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Hide the collection area completely so files no longer appear there, only in the floating stack",
      "reason": "The diff shows a 'hideCollection' prop added to GallerySection in HomePage.tsx, but the actual implementation of hiding the collection area is truncated in the diff. No clear evidence shows the collection area rendering logic is completely disabled or conditionally hidden.",
