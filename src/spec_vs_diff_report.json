However, the diff summary does not show the blue suitcase icon being replaced in the yellow page’s top-left UI location. There are also unrelated changes (e.g., URL parameter utilities) that were not requested.",

      "requirement": "Replace the existing “blue suitcase” icon with a minimal purple target/mission icon in all requested UI locations, including (1) the top-left icon on the yellow page of the app.",
      "reason": "The diff clearly updates the welcome intro/onboarding icon, but the provided diff summary does not show any change to the yellow page’s top-left icon (no explicit replacement location is visible in the truncated changes).",

      "reason": "The request is limited to replacing specific UI icons; modifications to mission screen logic or unrelated code are not requested. The diff summary indicates edits to this file but does not provide evidence that they are solely the requested icon swap.",
