  "summary": "Diff shows changes to backend/main.mo plus several frontend hooks/components. Evidence indicates some work on React Query caching (including a stated fix to useMoveFilesToMission to source files from any folder cache), but the provided diff summary does not clearly show complete implementation of immediate UI updates/rollback for both files and notes, nor the backend detachment guarantees. Several unrelated UI/features (e.g., speech-to-text and upload behavior changes) appear to have been introduced despite scope constraints.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Ensure moved files/links from a folder are removed from the source folder list immediately and appear in the target mission immediately, working from any folder cache, with rollback on failure.",
      "reason": "The diff summary only asserts (in a file summary) that useMoveFilesToMission sources files from any folder cache; it does not provide concrete evidence of (a) updating both source folder cache and target mission cache immediately, and (b) rollback behavior on failed move.",

      "reason": "No move-notes-to-mission hook or optimistic cache update/rollback logic is shown. The visible changes in useNotesQueries focus on fetching and note creation invalidation, not moving notes between folder and mission caches.",

      "reason": "backend/main.mo is truncated and does not show any move-to-mission method implementation or changes that demonstrate folderId clearing / missionId setting for files/links/notes or query behavior changes.",
