  "summary": "The diff implements a BigInt-safe task comparison utility and updates mission autosave change-detection to avoid JSON.stringify on BigInt-containing tasks (likely addressing the freeze/blank-screen). However, it also includes additional autosave behavioral changes (save-queuing and mission-switch resets) and updates to project metadata/summary files that were not requested.",

      "description": "Autosave behavior enhancements beyond BigInt-safe comparison: queuing pending updates while a save is in progress and resetting autosave internal state on missionId change.",
      "reason": "REQ-2 asks only to make change-detection BigInt-safe (avoid JSON.stringify on BigInt). The added queuing/mission-switch reset logic changes autosave behavior beyond comparison logic, and the BuildRequest constraints ask to avoid changing app functionality beyond the freeze/blank-screen fix.",
