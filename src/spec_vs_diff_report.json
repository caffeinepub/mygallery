  "summary": "REQ-2 and parts of REQ-3 appear addressed by removing blocking intro logic at the App level and shifting HomePage to render an authenticated shell while actor/data initialize. REQ-4 is only partially evidenced: there are opt-in perf diagnostics for the first completion of folders/files/missions queries, but the diff summary does not provide clear evidence for identity restoration timing or actor-initialization-to-ready timing logs. Several unrelated UI/feature additions (PWA config, major CSS/theme changes, dev smoke test trigger, new icons) appear beyond the stated scope.",
