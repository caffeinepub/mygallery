  "summary": "REQ-1/REQ-2/REQ-3 appear implemented at the configuration level (manifest, HTML meta/manifest link, SW registration and fetch handler). However, the required icon image files are not present in the diff, and the diff shows many non-PWA application changes that violate the stated constraint/non-goals.",

      "requirement": "Provide the generated MYL bullseye PNG icon files (192x192 and 512x512) at the paths referenced by the manifest so they load successfully (no 404).",
      "reason": "The manifest and index.html reference `/assets/generated/myl-bullseye-icon.dim_192x192.png` and `/assets/generated/myl-bullseye-icon.dim_512x512.png`, but the diff shows no added image files. Without the actual PNGs, the AC about icons loading successfully cannot be satisfied.",
