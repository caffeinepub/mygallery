  "summary": "MissionEditorDialog was modified with a new full-height, flex-column dialog layout (95dvh on mobile) and a header containing the Mission title input. The diff is truncated before showing the task entry row and the footer actions, so it cannot be verified from the provided evidence that the Add Task controls and Cancel/Create buttons are always visible without scrolling or that only the task list becomes scrollable as it grows.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "On mobile-sized viewports, the Mission title input, the Add task input + add button, and the primary actions (Cancel / Create Mission) must all be visible at once when the dialog opens (no scrolling); only the task list area should scroll if it overflows, while task input row and action buttons remain accessible.",
      "reason": "The MissionEditorDialog diff is truncated before the task input row and the primary action buttons are shown, so there is insufficient evidence that the layout pins the task entry controls and the Cancel/Create buttons while making only the task list scrollable.",
