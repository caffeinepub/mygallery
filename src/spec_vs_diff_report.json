  "summary": "REQ-1 appears implemented by lowering the z-index of the floating Folders/Missions buttons when bulk multi-select is active and by ensuring the gallery bulk action bar has a higher stacking order, coordinated via a new bulk-selection callback/state between GallerySection and HomePage. Some unrelated additions (dev smoke-test trigger, project_state tracking updates) are present.",
