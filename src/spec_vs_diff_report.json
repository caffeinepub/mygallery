  "summary": "Diff updates SwipeActionsRow with new swipe state/threshold logic to control action visibility, but also includes unrelated URL/session parameter utilities and project documentation/state changes. Evidence is insufficient to confirm consistent application across all SwipeActionsRow usages (Folders/Notes/Missions) beyond the component itself.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-8",
      "requirement": "Ensure the updated swipe-to-reveal behavior is consistently applied anywhere the shared SwipeActionsRow component is used (Folders list, Notes list on coarse pointer devices, Missions list on coarse pointer devices), without changing any backend behavior.",
      "reason": "The diff only shows changes inside the shared component. There’s no evidence in the diff summary that Folders/Notes/Missions list screens (or their row usage patterns/state wiring) were updated or verified to use the new open/close behavior consistently.",

      "reason": "REQ-7/REQ-8 do not request outside-click-to-close behavior; this is additional interaction logic beyond 'swipe back (or otherwise closed)'.",
