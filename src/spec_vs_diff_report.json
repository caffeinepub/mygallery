  "summary": "Manifest linking, manifest contents, service worker registration, and a minimal service worker with fetch handling/navigation fallback appear to be implemented. However, the diff also includes substantial unrelated UI/feature and styling changes, and there is no concrete diff evidence of addressing REQ-5 installability verification criteria beyond adding PWA files.",

      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "Verify and fix any remaining installability criteria issues (secure context, start URL reachable, no manifest/SW console errors blocking install prompt across major browsers).",
      "reason": "The diff shows adding/updating manifest, index.html link/registration, and sw.js, but does not provide evidence of addressing broader installability criteria checks (e.g., ensuring secure context in deployment, confirming start_url reachability in routing, or eliminating console errors across browsers). Those are primarily verification/outcome-based and not demonstrable from the provided changes.",
