  "summary": "REQ-1 and REQ-2 are largely implemented via an icon-only `IntroScreen` and new `App.tsx` logic to show the intro once per app load when an authenticated identity exists. However, the intro screen initially renders fully transparent/hidden for ~1s, which may violate the requirement that the icon be visible while the splash is visible. The diff also includes unrelated changes to actor initialization/admin token URL param utilities, which were not requested and may violate the constraint to confine changes to splash/intro behavior.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "When the splash screen is visible, the animated gallery icon remains visible and centered on the splash screen (icon-only splash).",
      "reason": "`IntroScreen` initially renders the whole splash container with `opacity-0` and the icon wrapper with `opacity-0`/scaled down until a 1s timer flips `isAnimating` to true, meaning the icon is not visible during the initial portion of the splash render.",
