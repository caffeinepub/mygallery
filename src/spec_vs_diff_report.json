  "summary": "SwipeRevealRow touch-only swipe-to-reveal infrastructure was added and integrated into Folders, Notes, and Missions views, with per-list open row state and outside-tap dismissal. However, the diff evidence for the exact iOS-style action button UI (labels/colors) and the exact note title edit flow from the list is incomplete/truncated. Some unrelated utilities and mission-detail change-detection logic were also modified/added beyond the swipe-action request.",

      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "On touch devices, swiping left on a note row reveals 'Edit' and 'Delete' actions (Delete red), stays open until dismissed, and Edit enables editing the note title from the list context using the existing note update mutation.",
      "reason": "NotesFullScreenView is truncated before the list-row rendering and swipe actions UI/handlers are shown; the diff snippet does not provide direct evidence that the 'Edit' and 'Delete' buttons (including red Delete styling) are rendered and that 'Edit' triggers an existing note-title update flow from the list context.",
