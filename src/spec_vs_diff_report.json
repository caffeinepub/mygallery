  "summary": "Frontend changes add explicit delete-confirm state and handlers in FoldersFullScreenView and MissionsFullScreenView that call the existing delete mutations and show success/error toasts. The diff does not provide evidence that React Query caches are invalidated/updated after deletion, nor does it show any backend deletion logic changes (backend file even states no changes needed).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Ensure backend deletion methods invoked by the swipe-to-delete flows correctly remove the target entities for the authenticated caller (folder deletion removes the folder record; mission deletion removes the mission record), and that frontend React Query caches are invalidated/updated so the UI state stays consistent with backend state.",
      "reason": "The provided diff only shows the UI calling delete mutations and toasts; it does not show any React Query invalidation/update logic in hooks or cache updates tied to these deletions. Backend file snippet explicitly indicates no changes and does not show deletion methods or fixes.",
