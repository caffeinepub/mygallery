        "summary": "Fix the link-opening flow so that the \"Unable to Open Link\" fallback dialog is not shown when a gallery link actually opened successfully and the user returns to the app after closing the link page/tab.\n\nThis includes adjusting the logic in the gallery link click handler so the fallback UI is only shown when the browser truly blocked opening the link (and not as a side-effect of leaving/returning to the app). If needed, incorporate page visibility/focus handling and/or a short delay before showing the fallback to confirm the app did not successfully navigate/open an external page.",
