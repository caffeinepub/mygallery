        "After actions that previously showed success/error/info toasts (e.g., creating a mission), no toast notification is displayed to the user.",
        "No other UI/UX, layout, navigation, or business logic changes occur aside from removing/hiding the automated toast messages.",

    "Do not change any application behavior or features other than hiding automated in-app messages/toasts.",

  "nonGoals": [
    "Adding a new notification system.",
    "Changing validation logic, mission creation/deletion flows, or error handling behavior beyond hiding the UI notifications.",
    "Translating or rewriting the toast message strings (they should simply not appear)."
