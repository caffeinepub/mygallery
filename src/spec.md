# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a Live Stack Inbox in the bottom-right corner of the Gallery that shows newly uploaded, unorganized files with visual feedback and animation.

**Planned changes:**
- Add slide animation (200-250ms) when file upload completes, moving file toward bottom-right stack
- Display stack in bottom-right corner with 3-5px diagonal offset between cards
- Show badge on stack with count of unorganized files
- Display "Unorganized" indicator on files in Gallery that haven't been moved to Folder or Mission
- Remove files from stack and remove "Unorganized" indicator when moved to Folder or Mission
- Ensure stack doesn't interfere with normal Gallery usage
- Apply professional, non-playful visual style to stack, animations, and indicators

**User-visible outcome:** Users see newly uploaded files animate into a visible inbox stack in the bottom-right corner, can track unorganized files via badge count and indicators, and see files automatically leave the stack when organized into Folders or Missions.
